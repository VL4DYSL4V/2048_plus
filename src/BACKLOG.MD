1) Implement concept of storing only powers of 2 in a fieldElements.
    Now it means only to refactor CellGenerator.calculateValue() to return 2 or 1 instead of 4 or 2.
2) Create threadsafe Model class, which must store: field, BigInteger scores and history
3) Crate ModelDao to persist Model somewhere
